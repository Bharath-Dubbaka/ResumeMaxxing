                     <strong>Tailoring Resumes:</strong> Adjusting resumes for
                     every job description is already exhausting. Tailoring them
                     for recruiters too? That is next level. And we have all
                     been told to ‚Äúkeep a master resume,‚Äù but how do you manage
                     it without drowning in multiple files?

                     <strong>ATS Compatibility:</strong> Recruiters often ask
                     for resumes in Word format as it is better suited for most
                     ATS globally. Issues like readability, format, and the
                     right keywords can make or break your chances.

                     <strong>The ‚ÄúPerfect Resume Structure‚Äù:</strong> Should I
                     use Word or PDF? What should be the format, font, or
                     alignment? These endless doubts add unnecessary confusion.

                     <strong>Keeping a Master Resume:</strong> To solve these
                     problems, we are told to maintain a master resume and make
                     multiple copies for different jobs, skills, or scenarios.
                     But this approach often leads to even more hassle and
                     confusion.
